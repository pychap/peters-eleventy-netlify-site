I was fortunate to get this template created by Andy Bell and others (linked below), created from Eleventy and hosted through Netlify. I purchased Andy's [excellent course on Eleventy](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/) and have finished it, yet working through it again. Currently I'm modifying the template to further fit my needs.

One aspect of a personal website for myself that I've always felt is critical, was its typography. Critical not only for beauty and aesthetics, but in a sense it should also communicate something about myself. I am a bit "old school". I love the classics - things that are labeled classics have been for a notable reason, their charactistics have stood the test of time, which is a purifying type of test. The other part of myself to communicate was that I am deeply involved in technology, I enjoy technology and all the benefits it has gifted mankind with.

So in looking I used "pairing" websites such as this one, and reached back on all my prior typography knowledge from my print design days. I decided on Serif headlines, and san-serif body copy (although Serif represents the classic aspect, tech - sans serif, is a much bigger part of me) and narrowed down to these choices
