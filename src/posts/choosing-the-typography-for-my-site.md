I was fortunate to get this template created by Andy Bell and others (linked below), created from Eleventy and hosted through Netlify. Currently I'm modifying this template to further fit my needs. I purchased Andy's [excellent course on Eleventy](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/) and have finished it, yet I'm working through it again to gain the learning benefits from repetition. My goal is to further customize this site from what I've learned. 

One aspect of a personal website for myself that I've always felt would be critical, was its typography. Critical not only for beauty and aesthetics, but in a sense it should also communicate something about myself. I am a bit "old school"; I love the classics - things that are labeled classics have been for a notable reason, their characteristics have stood the test of time, which is a purifying type of test. The other part of myself to communicate was that I am deeply involved in technology, I enjoy technology and I enjoy all the benefits it has gifted mankind with.

So in my typography search I used "pairing" websites [such as this one](https://fontpair.co/), and reached back on all my prior typography knowledge from my print design days, as well as taking advice from [Matej Latin's](https://matejlatin.co.uk/) excellent book [Better Typography for a Better Web](https://matejlatin.co.uk/books/2017/07/31/better-web-typography-for-a-better-web/). I decided on Serif headlines, and san-serif body copy. Although Serif represents my classic aspectâ€”tech, represented by sans serif, is a much bigger part of me, so that would be body copy. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, haha.   
  
I narrowed the choice down to [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) for headlines, [Fira sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) for body copy. Both feature a large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, both good for screen reading.
